title: Wooden Rings - Inlay
---

Decided to share the process of adding a crushed stone inlay to a wooden ring. Starting with an Indian Rosewood blank I prepared earlier, a channel has to be cut to receive the inlay.
A tool called a purfling cutter (easy to make or can be purchased from a Luthier supplier) is used to score two lines on the ring.

The area between the scored lines can then be chiseled out. Here I am using my trusty 2mm chisel. It may be necessary to periodically re-score and chisel to reach the target depth.

The process of inlaying the stones requires a surgeons hands and a good measure of patience. Using tweezers I position half a dozen or so stones at a time in the channel. In this case I am using Turquoise and Jasper.

A drop of thin cyanoacrylate glue is added to fix then in place. The glue has to be dropped onto the stones to avoid disturbing their position.

Once all the stones are set add more glue to fill any gaps before tediously filing and sanding up to 12000 grit and burnishing to a high gloss finish.
