I am a self employed craftsman based in Glasgow, Scotland. I am experienced in woodwork, electronics and computer programming.

You can follow my work on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/108624488609783583375/posts) and see what I have for sale on [etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Soundcraft?ref=hdr_shop_menu).

If you would like a custom made flute, ring or to commission anything at all [contact me](mailto:rabfulton@gmail.com).
